"OK, that's great.  "
Thank you Tommy.  
Thank you so much.  
You are welcome.  
"OK, so here we go.  "
Let's drive this assessment plan.  
There's some redundancy here as we pull things in as I assume there will continue to be redundancy as we overlap.  
This planning process and.  
Continue to assess those objectives.  
"Triangulation, right, and we're going to triangulate our our standard or skill objective and assessment today, so here we go.  "
Hardest thing to teach pre service teachers foundational triangulation.  
Do we want them to build anything?  
To submit that.  
"That's why I was thinking that first create an assignment, create a course within canvas, something like that.  "
OK.  
"Creation itself is a necessity, yeah?  "
One of the.  
"You know one of the things we're doing here, OK?  "
Can you create a course?  
Can you post an assignment?  
Right?  
Right?  
Would that be under the learners with synthesize would be creation of the course and assignment?  
"I think so, yeah.  "
"Yeah, that's good.  "
This would have to be.  
Have to be some sort of single point rubric evaluation of their of what they got.  
Did they they created?  
Did you do it?  
Did you not?  
Do it stop.  
I think you would get the evaluation of course creation or whatever they're doing the evaluation of.  
"Whatever tool that we're teaching them and evaluating its implementation, it's quality.  "
I think I I started that down there.  
How we're going to do that?  
"Frequency, content quality, type thing, what they're doing with it.  "
Looking at the content and the quality of their assessment creation.  
"That'd be interesting, or at least providing the tool for them to do that post.  "
Post session.  
I see where you have the self assessment survey and then the session quality.  
So with the self assessment is that like a reflective survey then?  
"I, I think if we.  "
Have that self reported data in there.  
It would suggest you you know how they're going to implement these things.  
We kind of survey them as to.  
So my thought was that this is really just one thing right?  
And we just disaggregate the questions that are about their implementation and versus the session quality.  
"So if we put this at the end, we're not taking measurements along the whole way formatively.  "
"But when we get this assessment piece at the end, if we give them 10 questions, 5.  "
"Of them are about what they're going to do with what they learned, and how they're going to implement that, and the others are about the quality of the session.  "
We just.  
We just gave them to help us guide the next time we do said session at another district.  
Thoughts Matt Haley.  
I don't know him.  
I'm just thinking 'cause we need to also create like.  
Write a brief detail about the assessment procedure.  
"I was wondering, do we want to do, uh?  "
Survey before this workshop.  
"Then after this workshop, it's.  "
Then we can have like a pre test data of life entry skills of the teachers.  
"Well, that's what I set up here at the top.  "
"So if we use one of the tools so when I put diagnostic data collection in here, that was exactly my thought that we would give them five to 10 question diagnostics using, uh, a data collection tool.  "
I use mentimeter in here I just threw that up and said.  
Easy data collection tool.  
"We can put it in there and then we can use that data for whole group, so that's probably what I would do to start with it like throw it up on the screen.  "
"If you'll notice here about how often you use these swivel tools already, only 40% of you are using it at a rate that is more than twice a week.  "
"Boom, this swivel is going to be using it five times a week or close to that, and in a virtual setting.  "
And so by the end of this session.  
"And that you know, how are your comfort level with using this twice a week or more.  "
Something like that so that you can see the growth.  
"Of what's presented, I'm just talking or thinking out loud right now, but that's that.  "
Was my thought where it says digital diagnostic data collection that we would use some sort.  
"One of those formative tools pull everywhere, mentimeter something to collect that data and then use that graphic as a whole group demonstration before we go into.  "
And then come back to those same questions in a different modality in the survey.  
That sounds great.  
"That that way they're getting it, and we're modeling the model.  "
"Like all right, here's data collection.  "
Here's a swivel tool.  
This is how we're using it.  
This is how we're modeling it for you.  
And then the Qualtrics data at the end is more sterile to provide graphic representations for what's driving us.  
"And and then we can send out individual ones to the participants if they put it in there, we could pop it back to them, or something like that later.  "
I want to mute myself so I don't talk.  
Maybe for the collaboration one because we're looking for an assessment or test item for it.  
Maybe that could be like a mind map or some type of curriculum map where in the course creation they have to then collaborate with their fellow.  
Teachers to be able to go and figure out how this is going to integrate across the curriculum.  
What are you guys thinking?  
I like that.  
"We can, uh, we can assess their mind maps, right?  "
They would be doing something.  
"Yeah, be easy.  "
They could use.  
A digital tool for mind mapping.  
Are you have you guys ever used dot storm?  
Every month.  
"I haven't, but I've heard of it.  "
Have you met?  
"No, I haven't.  "
"Haley, have you used dot storm?  "
"Uh, no, I don't think so.  "
I'm Googling.  
It right now.  
Sodium likes to put us in small little boxes and said it's.  
Not on the approved.  
List and the.  
Chances of it being approved are zero.  
Not storming.  
So dot storming allows a space where they can do that.  
Make mind maps or forget my account.  
I don't know what it is.  
"Well, darn.  "
We use the wall function where they can just kind of put something in the middle and then pop bubbles up around it to create that mind map.  
Or they could use padlet for that.  
Something like that as well.  
That use padlet.  
They can.  
They could use padlet for for this I'm going to go into what's going on here.  
So it would.  
I mean it could look something like.  
I guess this isn't going to work.  
We didn't pros and cons last night of.  
School culture but.  
They could associate padlet UM.  
"This one is not going to be as easy, but they could get.  "
The one that's.  
"You know, not structured like this and create padlet boards as well, but the dot storming allows it.  "
"It's a little easier I think, in less clunky and drag and drop function, but anyway, it doesn't matter.  "
"We could use a tool like this, or we could do it old school and have them do it.  "
Big stickynote pages.  
Depending on what we need.  
Either way.  
"So our quick, easiest one sometimes is jam board.  "
Jamboard as well.  
"Yep, so yeah since that'll integrate well.  "
"Yeah, jam board.  "
"Google integrations, easy.  "
There's another one that's really nice called Miro.  
Umm yeah.  
That one we we just used in Doctor ****** class and and it's really nice. Really nice. I like it a lot.  
Recommending that.  
"OK, I'm yeah, This is why we learn things and never **** Never had me use Miro so I'm on it now.  "
Channel 0 yeah.  
I don't know much about it because I'm I'm meeting up with the ETA.  
MIRV to talk about it and just to go through how to set it up and all that jazz so.  
But when we used it.  
It was everybody was flying all.  
Over the place that was really cool.  
"I'll grab the link, I'll send it to you of what we did in that class.  "
Sorry I'm looking at new new book for next year's class on the teenage brain.  
Scary thing.  
I like this already.  
Sorry I'm I'm lost on the mirror.  
I'm I'm I'm still looking.  
I apologize guys I am not feeling the greatest but we're gonna power through today.  
"Oh, here it is.  "
"OK, I got it.  "
"Yeah, I'm building building this.  "
It's a in the Miro and it.  
And they could put whatever swivel swivel tool that we're using.  
Let's say it's mroe but they're actually learning a second travel tool as we.  
Integrate in Jamboard as the swivel tool.  
So I just sent over the mirror that we used in class.  
And uhm.  
Lots of cool things and you could see.  
When people come.  
This would be really good on the.  
Smart boards.  
"Graphic graphic representations are cool, professional and color coding works nice here for visual representation.  "
And you could see like where people cursors are and what they're actually doing and thinking.  
Whereas Google.  
"Oh yeah, I see that.  "
I like it a lot.  
And it's already Google aligned.  
I mean integration with Google here is is quick and easy for this tool.  
"Which is, uh?  "
Maybe this is one of our swivel tools.  
"Yeah, absolutely.  "
I like it.  
I want to look at this tomorrow morning and see what I can do with.  
"Yeah, you put me in a rabbit hole Cam.  "
Better than this.  
"Well, I'm waiting to hear back from Merv, so when I hear back from her I will definitely ask you guys.  "
I'll get you guys into the conversation.  
If you want to come to our little.  
I I just need to know.  
More I'm I'm I'm.  
I can't learn it in.  
A class with twenty other people.  
"We could create a generic rubric, formative, evaluate formative assessment of Miro.  "
Mind maps  
If we're going to have them do some sort of data collection tool.  
We haven't necessarily discussed which which three tools we're going to focus on.  
I really like this one.  
Ones that are new or obscure obscure.  
We could do something like flipgrid.  
Which is used a lot but different ways to make videos part of part of your assessment and.  
"You're killing two birds with one stone, like how do you assess the video?  "
So we're assessing you about your own assessment about how you assess students using the video.  
"There's a lot of like Russian nesting dolls, kind of assessment piece.  "
And then whatever after tool is here.  
"I was kind of hoping that our textbook had more like a a way to put in the assessment procedure, but.  "
"When I read it, no.  "
Yeah I was.  
Just checking the table on page 141 and.  
OK.  
I'm on 141.  
cause this type of the test time is kind of.  
Organized like from the beginning to.  
The end.  
"Yeah, to the end.  "
"So I was wondering, can we just do something like this to like?  "
And demonstrate the procedure maybe.  
"Yeah, I think that would be.  "
I think that would be fine.  
And dumb.  
I was also thinking 'cause we 'cause it asked us to do.  
"So to also describe the analysis, maybe we can just have the test type, the procedure and analysis.  "
I want to put that in.  
"Oh, I had actually had a form.  "
Perfect.  
"I'm I'm just thinking, I'm not sure if you guys.  "
"Think this will work, but.  "
I'm just wondering.  
Maybe this is more.  
We can just have everything together.  
"Ah yeah, I see what you're talking about.  "
How detailed does she want us to get?  
Are we writing the test questions?  
Or are we just describing?  
I have the same question actually 'cause it's in the textbook.  
There are some examples.  
"That has the actual question, but.  "
"Oh, OK.  "
Check the rubric.  
I wanted to do an ideas video that pops up with this and it says meet the team and and then I we can like animate like Kim flies in as a superhero.  
"It's got like POW graphics, cop, comic graphics, and you've got a Cape on like this.  "
And that's our intro and then ID or slides up.  
Matt flies in is the Hulk.  
Is it?  
"Oh, it's so cool.  "
And then it just pops up like superheroes for each one of us.  
And then it says ideas United on it via excellent.  
And then we all come out to this whole group instruction to start with with a fog machine outstanding.  
Welcome.  
"OK, I should stop thinking and do something positive here.  "
"Oh sorry, Matt.  "
You go ahead.  
Pretests wannabe  
Turn it down.  
"Well, the rubric says about the assessment procedure.  "
Just one sentence.  
Explain the procedure of carrying out the assessment.  
That's it.  
It doesn't specify.  
We have to.  
Generate all the questions.  
So I guess a brief.  
"Uh, explanation will be fine, yeah?  "
Let's keep it brief.  
I'll create this quickly.  
"People stopped emailing me today, it's ridiculous.  "
"OK, let's create this quickly new presentation.  "
What if for?  
That beginning.  
So you have the digital diagnostic data collection things great.  
"Uhm, what if we also had them?  "
While they took that.  
"Just really quickly throw up like just brief reflection, like what do you?  "
Know about this.  
What do you know about Miro and they just throw it up there?  
"Uhm, like I know nothing like the Likert scale.  "
We could use.  
We could use the word.  
Cloud feature on one of these and say.  
What what digital tools do you use in your classrooms and and they would put up like pallet and wake lid and jam board and they would just do all these things and then we get this whole soup of all of these things are being used in your district and then we would ask how many of you use.  
Right?  
And then we could pull out four of them that we think as another tool on the screen.  
"Uhm, how many of?  "
"You have to cut you off, but what if we were?  "
To go and ask them to kind of.  
Follow up with that.  
What is one of the hardest things or I shouldn't say hardest but like what are the?  
What are the difficulties that you have when using these tools or adopting a tool?  
Because that might help us.  
"Uhm, when we tailor it to be.  "
You know?  
This is this is this is.  
"Hitting on that, you know what I mean, and I guess that would be kind of more of a skill.  "
"If you will, maybe I don't know.  "
I'm thinking very analytical today.  
Like a SWOT analysis of one of the tools.  
That would be great.  
So what does a SWOT analysis of padlet?  
But I totally get agree tamita.  
Hone down and like really use the word cloud to bring it in even further.  
"Well, it's just.  "
It's just that quick engagement tool.  
It's 3 minutes.  
We've got everything that's going on in the room.  
We've taken the temperature and then the word cloud feature is going to blow up the four that are used the most in the room and then we can address these swivel tools and then add to those.  
"Hopefully, diagnostically, it's not exactly.  "
But we're gonna teach them right?  
That would be the the thought.  
"Well, we're already doing these things we're going to add these three things today to your toolbox for swiveling and then figure out how all of those are supported in the post side of the session by administration in the district.  "
Totally agree.  
Swivel tools.  
"However, it seems.  "
I want to use poll everywhere instead of mentimeter because you can do more.  
You can ask more questions in a certain assessment than you can with mentimeter without a paid version.  
We're not gonna pay for it.  
Here's my.  
"Tommy, you may.  "
Wanna grant us access to this link?  
So then yeah.  
You mean to the the poll everywhere link?  
"Yeah, 'cause when I click it it says like.  "
I had to log in as the activity owner.  
"Oh yeah, I'm sorry.  "
The poll everywhere link would be.  
You mean the actual link?  
"Uh, for for students 'cause this would be my creation link, sorry.  "
"Oh no, that's fine.  "
I guess for the assignment.  
We can just put the.  
Home page of the website.  
It doesn't matter.  
"Right, yeah?  "
She she's not gonna care.  
Whole.com  
Like I got an.  
"Idea before they go into the workshop, like they're getting ready week before.  "
What if they send us what they have already done and that's their entry level skill test.  
It's an artifact.  
"Exemplare or something, yeah?  "
Is is that OK?  
Can I run with that?  
"Yeah, so for that I'm sorry I'm.  "
I say go with it.  
"Sorry, go ahead.  "
"Sounds good, yeah, go with it.  "
"Yeah, I agree and so how are we gonna?  "
Unless that like a case study or anything.  
I think just keep it simple.  
"So if you're already using, let's say one of like a a digital tool for online instruction, send us a link to that tool that you've already used so we can check it out and see.  "
We can look at it.  
And that can be used to introduce the presentations that these are your best practices that you're already doing.  
Right?  
That's great.  
It gives by and say these.  
Are what your colleagues are working on.  
I'm not telling you what you're working on.  
Love the buy in gas.  
"Yeah, please get in.  "
I was just thinking.  
Thank you Matt.  
Stop this.  
Now with the Self assessment survey.  
In this session quality survey.  
Are those going to be through mentimeter or would they be through a different?  
"Oh, we'll use the Qualtrics platform.  "
"Qualtrics that's right, OK?  "
"Well, make this.  "
This is irrelevant at this point.  
I think in the creation.  
"Uhm, really what?  "
What tools are we going to put in here right?  
cause the idea would be?  
"Uhm, this thing pair?  "
"Share model of instructional delivery for each one of them, right?  "
So you assess the whole group.  
You take the temperature of the room.  
"Then we do micro mind maps and allow exploration or as some explanation talk through them, allow that allow the attendees to create a.  "
Amiro account and then have them.  
Once they get that created then we can do one together.  
I like to do it about things that have nothing to do with what's going on.  
So like last night I was teaching my students how to use.  
Padlet and we looked at vacation destinations with the beach and then they had to associate lodging where they would stay in that location and they dropped all that into the padlet and.  
I said OK.  
So how do we do this now?  
Maybe with vocabulary or a topic that you have?  
Let's go English 9 and look at The Hunger Games alright.  
"And so when you're looking in your English class about characterization and The Hunger Games or social implications, how does this look around your padlet?  "
So my my question would be what tools are we going to use?  
I think this.  
I think Miro is great.  
I think we should use.  
"Yes, that's my only pitch.  "
"Yeah, of the other two can be whatever because I think this is one that's a fringe that most of the like the the zietgeist of K12 education probably is not using so.  "
"Uh, it might be nice to look at that. What else? What else do you think is just K12? Teachers need to do this and they need to do it effectively.  "
Or 712 teachers.  
In our case.  
"I I I I I really did like Matt's idea and then Tommy, your idea of a flip grid.  "
And and more video.  
"And and really, going with that is that where you're getting at?  "
Yeah well flip grids fine we can use.  
"Uhm, I think most people know it exists but don't know how to utilize it effectively.  "
"So providing that space in a flip flipped classroom model would be fine here so Miro, mind, maps and flipgrid.  "
What will be our third tool that we're going to teach in this session that we're going to use?  
In partnership with our company Ideas United.  
"I'm trying to my kindergarten just went remote yesterday or today, so I'm trying to get 5 year olds to log into their computer from home.  "
It's going to teach.  
A different set of swim language.  
Completely different set of swiveling tools there.  
"Yeah, it's like I'm going to turn off my camera and cry and.  "
You're not going to see it.  
Right?  
I have a kindergartner at home and I'm really crossing my fingers.  
That doesn't happen.  
"Yeah, we make a remote with kindergarten today and I have some very frantic parents.  "
"Saying, what do we do?  "
And their teacher is 70 plus and is also.  
Not sure what to do.  
Oh wow so.  
I have my extreme age ranges right now.  
"So regarding what tools we want to teach, I was.  "
Wondering do we want anything?  
Like regarding how to.  
"I mean, uh, give students feedback or get like information from the students behavior that teachers can reflect on.  "
I'm I'm not sure I'm thinking.  
One that I used last semester.  
"Uhm, is pardek for Google Slides.  "
Seeing that probably a lot of them have Google classrooms or optimized for Google classrooms.  
I was gonna suggest pardek as the as the because we've.  
Got a digital collaboration tool?  
"We've got a digital creation tool, a synthetic tool, and then paradax as an application.  "
"Tool so we we kind of go across the board and then if we sprinkle in things that we aren't directly teaching, like using one of those word cloud features.  "
"And to gather form of assessment data from one of those companies that use that function and then instead of using Qualtrics, why don't we use Google forms?  "
Because then we will also show them how to do that.  
"Even though I like the qualitex graphics and it provides a lot better data for us as a a company coming in to do this, I think it is better for the teachers to see modeled use of a Google app.  "
Thoughts on that?  
"Agreed, 'cause then you can use Google forms.  "
You can bleed them.  
Until you can.  
Use like choice Eliminator to change kind of like dynamic test Blue brew just.  
Self grade it and.  
I changed that back here.  
"I change it at the top and say, UM assessment tools instead of Qualtrics.  "
I'll put in Google forms 'cause that'll.  
And applications Google forms and applications right so we can show them how to.  
Utilize that and then we can give the pre assessment and the post assessment in Google forms to to see that data beside itself.  
And then we can download that as a CVS file and then go from there.  
For our own growth model of data analysis.  
"Yes, have an issue with loops.  "
I I am yes.  
"OK, let me switch here.  "
"Now, OK.  "
I'm gonna I'm gonna go to a different.  
"UM Haley, are you running the meeting I gave you host right?  "
It's not gonna stop if I get off of here.  
"Yeah, it's not.  "
I I've so I have IT here to.  
Work on my desktop.  
"I'll pop into this from a different location, give me just a second.  "
And so have you.  
Guys heard of the like the Google Teacher certificate?  
"There's a Google yeah, teacher one.  "
There's a Google coaching certificate too.  
Oh yeah.  
Literally no.  
So it's like you as I train the trainer type of certificate.  
"Oh wow, yeah, the Google educator and there's different levels of Google educator.  "
"Yes, Google educator certificates.  "
Certain limited will educator.  
So that's just weird.  
If I can hear.  
"Yeah, this just.  "
Started to remind me of like 'cause that one teaches you how to use Jsoup to teach online.  
And use Google forms for assessment and.  
All those fun things.  
"Yeah, there's level one and level 2.  "
I put it in the chat.  
Here is one of the newer ones.  
The certified Google coach.  
Oh wow.  
And that's the one that.  
Right?  
My district is pushing me to complete.  
"Well, I thought.  "
And you have to report.  
"Oh, go ahead, Haley.  "
"No, no, no.  "
I was just saying that I got the level 1 educator certificate a couple years ago and I I don't really use it so I.  
Don't remember why.  
They're still here.  
"Well, it's going to say.  "
"Kind of piggybacking off of that, there you have to report 100 hours of 1 on one coaching each year.  "
Wow to maintain it.  
"But technically, that's my full time job, so.  "
OK.  
It's true I can do that.  
I think they have online communities that other teachers can ask you questions or ask you to coach them.  
I guess that counts as well.  
Does does.  
This cost money to do this.  
The test costs like $20 I.  
Think for the educator certificates.  
OK.  
That's not that's not bad at all.  
"I had a Microsoft certificate at one time for I think different and a few different Microsoft programs, but that was a long time ago.  "
"Oh yeah, I think Apple has one.  "
Yeah wow.  
Just trying to like.  
See what else we can use for our assignment in the G suit.  
I should use Jamboard.  
I don't really like it.  
It doesn't have much like many features.  
"No, it almost feels like PowerPoint.  "
"That's just been taken apart, yes.  "
The thing I don't like about Jamboard is it's really clunky and students can make more boards and I don't know.  
"Maybe I need a little bit more control than that, but sometimes when I have a student who's not really interested.  "
They just start messing with it.  
That kind of lasted maybe 5 minutes.  
Jamboard with 5th graders can get very interesting.  
"Especially when they're at full, there's nothing to do.  "
That's why I like Nero.  
That's why I like Nero because you're able to lock in place elements on the board.  
"So as I was like doing stuff with Miro in the class, I had some people were moving stuff on me, which is pretty normal in Google Jamboard, but I locked it and so they couldn't move it.  "
"That would be I may have to look into that and mention that because even with professional meetings, people do things by accident.  "
"They don't know what they're clicking on and things get deleted and messed up, and then the instructor spends 10 minutes regrouping.  "
"Yeah, exactly.  "
With other teachers so.  
Much less 10 year olds at.  
Home with a computer.  
"Sorry, I'm upside down.  "
Document camera.  
And there we go.  
We were just doing our weaknesses of ambord  
Check check 122.  
Check check 1-2.  
We can hear you.  
Makes sense.  
I'm in good.  
What did I?  
Miss how are we doing?  
I just.  
Pulled up the file.  
"When you were logging in, we were just talking about the.  "
Difficulties of jam board.  
So I will go splat on this and how kids can change things without you wanting them to change things or not.  
Oh yeah.  
Kids adult students.  
All of the above.  
"We come, I shared that.  "
Miro allows you to be able to.  
"Like lock items on the board so people can't delete them, move them, edit them, nothing.  "
And what I really hate about Jim board is that you cannot insert a page like in this.  
In the slides flow.  
You can just.  
I was I was just when I wanted to insert a page I had to like move all the content backwards like manually.  
I think we need.  
To create a needs analysis for Jamboard and then submit it to them.  
And got the soundings for our company.  
And that's exactly how you get hired to take over Google Haley right there.  
Looks good everybody.  
This one seems a bit more concise than what we were doing before as far as what's expected.  
We're not doing Qualtrics right.  
"No, we're going to use Google forms instead.  "
"OK, I'm just gonna replace that out of the assessment alignment ones.  "
Sorry about that.  
"Oh no, it's fine.  "
I was just trying to think of for me.  
Like I said I love those graphics and Qualtrics pops out really nice things that can just be implemented right into the presentation.  
"As we take back to our bosses at our company, but in this case the Google forms are way more practical for the teachers.  "
In said district.  
"I also appreciate that our mission is the same and as soon as I said that nobody had to push back against, well, it looks prettier or it doesn't look prettier because it was.  "
It was about teacher development and so that's good.  
Nobody went well.  
I don't like the tools here because it's clunky and it looks tacky.  
Or this?  
So thank you all for not.  
"Unified you, that's it.  "
"Just as long as we don't use the ones that we have at here, we we use paper for everything and when we went virtual finally use Google forms 'cause we don't have Qualtrics for faculty for whatever reason.  "
So I love Google forms.  
So I'm no pushback here.  
I use it.  
All the time.  
Then Google forms works on every.  
Device so you don't have to worry about what students have.  
"Yeah, any any time I'm getting feedback data from cooperating teachers in the field.  "
That's true.  
I use Google because they're familiar with Google forms and that since familiarity makes it easier and quicker for them to provide feedback of student teacher development.  
I like that.  
My parents at my school had started using Google forms so the TSL started adopting it and now other parents use Google forms for the boosters club and so now the kids learn it and they taught their parents.  
Now they're using it back so.  
That's great.  
That's a lot of fun.  
"What do we have left here, everybody?  "
At the top.  
I can't think of what missing.  
Just kind of looking at the top where.  
We're going here.  
Kim the raccoon has decided to.  
Thank you for helping up here.  
She's an anonymous raccoon.  
Tommy says you showed I showed the opposite of your outside versus.  
My tiny little bow.  
Oh yeah.  
"Yeah, Oh my goodness.  "
You have a view here.  
"Wow, Bloomington.  "
The opposite of.  
"Part roll, Indiana  "
I also just got a little frightened by the heights in which you live.  
Just all of a.  
Sudden my my fear of heights open.  
Only 31 stories.  
Oh guys.  
This is 31 stories.  
Oh my goodness.  
"Yeah, it's beautiful beautiful today.  "
Is it?  
"Yes, it is perfect weather.  "
It's like 70 degrees outside wow.  
What's it doing in Bloomington?  
It was a little bit.  
"Foggy this morning, but it's fine now.  "
"God, it was foggy.  "
"It was slick, bald over here.  "
Has been raining.  
To the east.  
"Well, it's been raining here for three days.  "
I need to fix my roof with some tar because a tile I have slate roof and a tile came off so it's dripping into my roof.  
"Right now I'm trying not to look at it or think about it, but I think Friday it'll stop raining.  "
How was Columbus Haley?  
Ohio State.  
"I I didn't go to Columbus, I stayed in Pittsburgh for the whole weekend.  "
OK.  
"Yeah, Pittsburgh.  "
"Saturday was fine, but it started to rain on Sunday and I guess it's just a really huge cloud.  "
cause I I'm yeah my friend.  
We drove 6 hours back and the whole like Cross Pennsylvania and Ohio and Indiana is all like.  
Cloudy and drugged me.  
Did do anything cool in Pittsburgh?  
Were you in the city?  
"Uhm, it's a small city I would say and just we went to couple like exhibitions of like.  "
"Andy Warhol and the Mattress Factory Museum or some like contemporary arts, which I don't understand, but they look fun, so yeah.  "
Did you go on the incline?  
The the right little train that goes is yeah I I did the last time when I got there.  
So this time we just we just drove to the top 'cause that incline is.  
Yeah it was really cute.  
It was really cute.  
cause the train is in red color and there are several bridges down on the river that are painted in yellow and there are like green trees and like pink purple skyline when at the sunset.  
So that was really that wasn't view.  
Yeah but.  
That was great.  
We had fun.  
To heaven.  
My fiance and I had looked into getting married down there because he's from down there.  
"Yeah, at Saint Stans Church which is like downtown downtown.  "
"Because they're all apart, we he's a huge Steelers fan.  "
Let's watch every week.  
I know it's sad.  
"But uhm, but yeah so.  "
"Enjoy, there's this really good Greek restaurant, so next time you go let me know 'cause there's two restaurants you need to check out.  "
There's this like little Azorean Portuguese restaurant.  
"It's to die for, and this Greek restaurant where this guy sells you all this stuff.  "
But it's so good.  
I should have asked you before I go.  
How would you know?  
"We wanted this restaurant at the top, but I don't know if you guys can see.  "
"It, but it's.  "
"Oh, you took that.  "
"Yeah I did, oh.  "
I'm so sorry.  
"There's like, uh.  "
Somebody knocking at my door just go check real quick.  
What else do we have left?  
Here folks before I switch out of this meeting and go into faculty Senate.  
I think we're good.  
That's great.  
I think it looks fine.  
Since it's all theoretical.  
Theoretical and it's it has to be redundant so.  
Let's buy.  
"It's redundant so well, I'm going to pop off and let us know what you need from us.  "
I will just.  
"Kim, before this gets submitted so.  "
"No, I'm I'm good.  "
I'm just going to dress it up a little bit and make it look nice.  
Probably be 5 pages in total.  
"cause of the just the way that things break up, but it'll be fine.  "
OK.  
And then we have.  
"We have a little gap, but for our next.  "
Assignments do right.  
"Oh yeah, next one is due on October 18.  "
The 16th maybe?  
18th yes.  
"Yeah, so do we wanna arrange our next meeting of that?  "
This time works well for me.  
I don't know it works for Matt.  
"It looks like I don't know what what you're like, Kim.  "
Perfect.  
"I'm fine, I can do this time.  "
Do you wanna meet next week and get it hammered out?  
"Get ahead, we can.  "
We can for sure.  
"Yeah, the 18th is Monday.  "
What's that line square?  
Yeah we can do next.  
We can do next Tuesday.  
Next Tuesday.  
Be on next Tuesday.  
Anytime is good for me.  
"Uhm, just left.  "
"Early or later, it doesn't matter.  "
Teacher work day at asynchronous so.  
"Oh nice, what about you, Haley?  "
"I'm I'm just wondering, 'cause doctor 'cause our instructor you used to post everything on Monday or Sunday.  "
I just wanted to make sure that we have the materials out before our meeting.  
It seems like she posted.  
I think they'll probably they'll probably be out on the week.  
"Eight will be out Sunday night or Monday morning, I would say.  "
I could pop into her office hours this Friday.  
Haley and ask.  
"But the 11th is Columbus Day, so I don't know.  "
We can schedule the 12th and then.  
We can move it if we need to.  
"Yeah, sure.  "
We'll have a whole week of buffer time in there.  
That works for me.  
And I'll send out.  
I'll send out this stuff to and figure out what we need and then we'll go from there.  
"Oh, by the way guys, there is the extra credit coming up tomorrow.  "
Oh yes.  
"At 6:00 PM central time, 7:00 PM Eastern Time.  "
2:00 AM mountain time.  
"With that, yeah, what time is that?  "
My time.  
Oh my God.  
So I might put it on my phone because I'll be teaching a class at 6:00 PM tomorrow night.  
So there you go.  
I miss.  
"She does assign the extra credit, so yeah.  "
I'll dream of extra credit.  
We have a 100 in.  
The class right now so.  
"Yeah, have have a nice dream and I may or.  "
May not log in so.  
"Alright, Joel, I'd rather be here chatting with you or sitting there terrified with Matt in his.  "
"31st floor, high rise, but I have to go listen to a roomful of PHD's talk about policy, so have a nice day.  "
Have a great day guys.  
Byron buddy.  
Thanks everyone.  
Bye bye. 
"I'm doing testing too and that's why I have a Ukrainian, Russian, Azerbaijani and Turkish dictionary for Monday. "
This meeting will not be in Turkish. 
"Well, I've got the dictionary. "
We need it so we can just switch to Azerbaijani. 
"No, Russian that's not so bad. "
But it's in Ukrainian. 
That's not us. 
So Monday will be fun. 
"So do we want to divide and conquer some of these things, or do we want to throw out ideas under each one of these bullet points and how they're scored and then kind of look at? "
Do we want to make a we've? 
"We've discussed pacing a little bit in previous sessions, but what materials do we need? "
"Uhm, how? "
How's the sequence go through this and. 
"Uhm, good question. "
So sorry. 
"No, go ahead, you go ahead Hun. "
I I was I'm I'm just reading the our assignment from week five which we have like main steps. 
"Of the instruction, I guess we can just go through that and see what materials we need for each of the steps. "
Were the learning objects. 
And put them together just so that these two maps with each other. 
And I'm pulling up her comments from the last. 
She had concerns about timing. 
OK. 
I think she mentioned that in our call to Gina. 
"Oh yes, yes. "
We're doing we're doing too much or we're possibly doing too. 
Much at one time. 
To reduce it to two or three items. 
"I'm fine with that if we want to just do two items rather than three, that might really decrease that that time, like she had suggested. "
I think ultimately this will be one of those divide and conquer things though. I'm looking at like the smart instructor manual from one of the other groups in the 100. 
73 pages. 
Watch the screenshots. 
"Right and on top of that, we have the formative assessment which. "
"It, which is it's not definitely not as involved, but for the for the HIV one that was 10 pages. "
I don't know what it is for the smart one. 
Smart ones. 
20 pages. 
Come all together for that. 
"So, uhm, maybe that's maybe that's what we could do is we could divide up. "
Because we have to we essentially we have to make it looks like. 
They made. 
An instructor guide. 
A learner manual or a worksheet workbook I should say. 
Do we have to do a PowerPoint? 
I don't think we have to with them. 
To go back and see what we were we talked about last time. 
"Oh, thank you. "
"My, my mom and dad are on the other side of me watching television. "
"So if you hear every now and then somebody say something, they're very quiet but they love listening apparently to all of my meetings. "
They're learning just as much as I am. 
"Well, this is. "
Add some humor because Tommy is on mute and he is a poor sick child so. 
And there's nothing funny. 
There's nothing funny about a poor sick child. 
"I don't, I don't think so. "
"I because the way that it, uh, the way that it's laid out when I just look at. "
These things it's just. 
We have to have learning materials and a learner guide and that's it. 
"So, and the formative evaluation. "
"Yeah, I don't see any for a PowerPoint. "
So that's a really good question of how we want to. 
How we want to break this up? 
Do we want to have three folks working? 
On on. 
On the learner and. 
Do do we all want to work on separate sections of each of the manuals? 
Do we want to have two people work on the learner manual and two people work on the instructor manual? 
We can't forget about the formative evaluation part. 
I think it's fine free. 
If we just decide what. 
"Uh, what? "
Like subtopics we want to have in the manuals and divide them. 
Up then we just set up like a deadline for everybody so we can put everything together. 
"Haley, what what document were you thinking that we were going to take that from? "
I'm just looking it up now. 
The same in week five I had put the link in the chat. 
"OK, perfect. "
"Yeah, I remember there's one that has like 10 minutes, 20 minutes this, but I can't find it now either. "
"Oh, that one was time. "
Let me see. 
But we had one overtime. 
We did. 
I think it should be this one. 
I found the time I'll send it. 
Here's in the chat. 
"You found it too, Haley. "
I don't know how much discussion do we need a formative assessment because we only have 3 questions. 
That's a good question. 
"As a three question formative assessment, we've already. "
We have that so. 
"It would be screenshots, I guess, of how we plan on presenting the formative assessment. "
So look at the ROTC one. 
"It's it's not the prettiest compared to the others, but that one might be the one that's. "
Closest to. 
To us 
"Uhm, although they do have a lot of interview questions. "
The one that I thought that might be the easiest to understand is the smart goals one. 
We actually have a framework for the formative evaluation in the textbook. 
I can start a Google doc off that. 
So if you want I can take the formative evaluation part and work on that and. 
And try and really put something together for that. 
For next week. 
"Yeah, we could split up the instructional artifacts. "
"Yeah, exactly, that's what I'm thinking. "
"And Tommy, this is our world. "
I think for some of this teachers. 
"Yes, that's what I was gonna say. "
That would make. 
Sense for you and I to share this one. 
Let's share the activity of zoom instruction first that we want to. 
Layout and then uhm. 
Match the pacing with that right? 
'cause her concern was pacing. 
And we do. 
I'm looking through some of our documents we. 
Have lots of different. 
"Ideas, we just need to focus. "
"We have in one document we're using this this tool, this tool and this one in the next we're using something else. "
"Yeah, when we come back into, uh, I mean we have that paste out, already identified tools and strategies. "
"5 minutes best practices, 10 minutes case analysis 20. "
Reflection of current practices 10 tools 10 accounts. 
She suggested removing the create creation of accounts. 
In the in the comments. 
And then content creation. 35 minutes student implementation. 20 minutes. 
So that was instructional allocation. 
From a few times ago. 
We can break down what we have there and just triage the importance and what we want to remove and then create the pacing outline. 
That sounds good. 
"Yeah, I think we can knock that out, Matt. "
OK. 
Then I guess I can start with learner manual. 
"Uhm, but I guess the learner manual should map with the instructor guide, so we may wanna like decide something like steps or stuff so that we can. "
Start together or I can wait for you guys. 
Come finish. 
Maybe halfway then that can start. 
What do you think? 
Were we just? 
"Yeah, if Tommy, you and I we create something 1st and then yeah maybe midway. "
I like your idea. 
I think so. 
I think that's it. 
"Yeah, you can bubble along. "
Then I will join on and I can go and and work on whatever whatever. 
I you know what I could do? 
If we could pick out today. 
"During this meeting, the two instructional tools that we're going to use, I can gather information about those so that way it's it's just data dumped into one area and we don't have to worry about trying to find stuff. "
I'm I'm just thinking in the case of Miro. 
'cause I know that most of us are pretty unfamiliar with it. 
If it's one that we decide to to use. 
I think that one. 
"The one we should yeah, stick with real. "
What's the second one? 
Do you guys think that we should use? 
We have Myril flip grid and pier deck. 
I would almost say flipgrid. 
That's personally to me because it para deck. 
"Uhm, you have to pay for some, some tools and flipgrid is it's free. "
"But I don't know, man, I don't know if I cut. "
You off and I apologize. 
"No, no how it's going to agree and pardek in some ways depending on how we did it could just end up being. "
PowerPoint with questions on it so. 
It's very true. 
Have you guys used nearpod? 
"I just went through a presentation with it and it was really cool, but. "
"It's like pardek, but a little bit more. "
I don't know it. 
"It seemed like it was a little bit more user friendly, especially for young kids. "
It it seemed like it had a lot of really cool things. 
"But OK, so we're going with Flipgrid and Miro. "
"Hey Tommy, do you think that you could share the folder where you have all these files in Google? "
Yeah OK cool. 
'cause I was trying to find the link and I don't know if maybe I just. 
"Oh my gosh, I found it. "
Thank you so much. 
You found it. 
"No need, yeah, I found it. "
Right? 
Thank you so much. 
So what I can do is if it will help you. 
"Well if it will help us, not you, but if it will help us, I can put together UM. "
Things that are out there for flipgrid and marrow. 
That people have already made. 
So that way we're we can kind of plug and chug as we as we go. 
"And then when Tommy and Matt have that outline laid out, then Uhm, Haley and I, we can. "
We can get along with it just fine. 
"Yeah, I, I guess Kim you're fine to start with the formative assessment and I'll just, uh, do what I can with the learner manual based on the. "
Our previous decisions with assignments and when Matt and Tommy have the outline now start and we can start to. 
"Put things together, maybe we can set a deadline like two or three days before the deadline of this assignment so we can just all. "
Look into what we have together and make some at it. 
"This is June the 20th, is that right? "
"Yes, yes. "
"Well, do you want to meet sometime next week so we can kind of check in with each other? "
Because that leaves us with. 
"So as it stands today, we have two weeks to be able to get. "
Essentially almost 200 pages worth of material. 
Complete and I just don't think I'm just putting it out there being totally real. 
I don't think that that's going to be enough time to be able to marry the two with everyone schedules. 
"At this same exact time, the 12th. "
It's good to me. 
"Yep, healthworks. "
"Does that work for you, Tommy? "
Then Tommy would you like to meet maybe Monday? 
That sounds good man. 
So you and I can meet Monday when I come. 
You want you want. 
4:30 or five on Monday. 
Let's just do five same time. 
I5 is good. 
And maybe Hailey. 
"Uhm, I was thinking about this for the but for the learners manual you can. "
I think you could start with an introduction page. 
You could also do the note pages because it seems like every good workbook has note pages in the back. 
And maybe if you wanted to do a little bit of the graphic stuff. 
"If you're like, oh, I love that stuff. "
You could start on. 
You could start on that. 
At least it'll it'll give you something to to go with and. 
"Uhm, I will get started on doing the the teachers manual. "
The facilitator manual. 
I'll get the front cover going. 
The inside the agenda part and then that way when Matt and Tommy. 
"Uhm, have their stuff put together. "
We can just we can. 
We can have a template already. 
"Together, if that sounds good to everybody. "
That's great. 
So I'm I. 
I swear that I'm not so a type. 
It's just when I saw the size of these documents. 
I got a little concerned. 
"That's true, they have like over 200 pages together that's. "
"Just comparing with assignments, we finished. "
This is. 
It's a very. 
"It's not the bluff Matt, that's for sure, it's the fluff. "
"Yes, no it's not. "
"Other than Haley, do you maybe the the three of us to meet on the 10th? "
Wednesday 2nd. 
Let me. 
And here I'll be a I'll be a part of that that's no problem. 
Maybe we can meet. 
"Yeah, Wednesday this is a progress progress report. "
On Wednesday I can do. 
10:30 to 12:00. 
Sorry and. 
4:00 to 6:00 PM. 
"Sorry, my schedule was just weird. "
Or I can do Tuesday? 
"Like, uh, what time slot would you guys prefer? UM Wednesday 10:30 to 12, maybe? "
I can. 
10:30 there's a yeah that works for me. 
That works for you Tommy. 
I think about 10:30. 
"I'm going through it right now. 10:30 so 5:30 for Matt on Wednesday, OK? "
Works for me. 
I have no meetings next week. 
"Thursday is Veteran's Day, so I have nothing on Thursday. "
What's that? 
Worst time of the year for me. 
If I if I get crazy. 
This week we have all of the field placement portfolios coming in this week. 
"It'll be fine, I'm fine, it's fine, everything's fine. "
We'll be fine when Thanksgiving comes. 
We'll all be fine. 
"Uhm, so Madam, Tommy will meet next Monday then. "
"Uh Matt, Tommy and Haley meet next Wednesday. "
Then everybody meets next Friday. 
So I'm making these. 
"Yeah, I'll show you in on the Wednesday. "
Schedules right now. 
"Morning oh, go ahead, I'm sorry Tommy. "
"I'm making, uh, I'm doing, uh, links to send out for everybody. "
For these right now. 
"No, thank you so much. "
"And I'll join in on your Wednesday meeting if you don't mind and then that way I can give you a progress report on the formative assessment, 'cause hopefully by that time I'll have it banged out. "
"Yes please, that would be great. "
And then I can join in on helping with whatever. 
So are we meeting Friday 12th? 
10:00 AM and that's 5:00 AM for Matt. 
Do you think that they really sent this off to be assessed? 
Or if those folks? 
Made up that. 
Assessment data 
Made up 
"OK, thank you. "
100%. 
I can make it up. 
"I just sent you three meeting links so everybody get those Monday, Wednesday, Friday next week. "
Got it? 
Can I put a Microsoft education link to flipgrid? 
"I don't know what it is, but it looks. "
Like it may be helpful. 
"Awesome, yes? "
"And uh, that's what I'm actually going to do today. "
OK. 
Red educator so awesome. 
"Yes, I'm going. "
To put together those resources for us all. 
"Uhm, there have been some resources that I've used in the past for flipgrid, but I'm. "
"Uhm, that whatever you have that you want to send, I. "
We'll put it all together and I'll also make sure that there's some type of document that walks through what everything is instead of. 
"It's just like a gobbled up mess, so these are the important things from each and then that way we don't have to go through every single thing. "
"You said you sent that in the chat, right, Matt? "
I did. 
"OK, perfect thanks. "
"Ooh, I didn't realize that Flipgrid was Microsoft. "
I did not either. 
Hey guys. 
"This is like, oh, it's Microsoft. "
Did not know. 
"Well, this course would have been really helpful. "
"Well, actually. "
"Uhm, have you guys considered to like? "
"Maybe if we all like this a lot, we can have it submitted to some kind of. "
Conference at the Workshop project. 
'cause Alice I Alice Alice is. 
And this is the name of the conference. 
"This is so covered for learning sciences, so I'm not sure if you guys have heard of it. "
My lab is submitting something to this and I happen to came through that they have like a workshop session. 
"Well, it's not something. "
"I mean, yeah, it's not time sensitive, but just in a thought that maybe we can do something with this. "
'cause Kim was saying that this can be really. 
"Useful conference is, uh, in June is that? "
What I saw. 
"Yes, it's June in Japan, actually. "
But we can just submit a proposal for this I guess. 
Sinicola skip. 
"Also, is she in New Orleans in June? "
What is the New Orleans sent you again? 
It's the it's he's in New Orleans. 
June 26th June 29th. 
Call for proposals opens August 30. 
This is. 
"Alright, let's Polish it. "
"Get it ready to go, and then we'll figure out where to distribute. "
"Yep, yeah. "
Just the idea. 
It's a good one. 
"Yeah, go with it hilly. "
We wanna get out of the country. 
Matt needs a vacation. 
Tommy needs. 
You need an assistant. 
"And Haley, yes. "
"Put it down, why not? "
We can all apply for travel funds and flat to Japan. 
Maybe the weather could help Tommy child honestly. 
With the weather changes go someplace tropical. 
Would be so nice. 
"Just thought yeah, I'm 7 hours away from the Mediterranean I think. "
So how bored am I this weekend? 
Take your language books with you. 
"Alright, I've got links out for Monday, Wednesday, Friday. "
"To put this in line, Matt start working on the. "
"Uh, artifacts, I dropped an outline template in for us to. "
Not perfect. 
Kind of go through. 
Introductions and and move from there. 
Sounds good. 
Can't see they'll probably do anything tonight though. 
"No, no, no. "
I won't either no. 
"OK, so between, yeah, you're in a hospital and I think we're all kind of exhausted. "
Not at all. 
"Exhausted for sure, so I'm gonna try to limp in with with you guys in in to the finish line here with with this. "
Here we go. 
December is insight so. 
It's here. 
And think of it. 
"But it's before Thanksgiving, best Christmas present, ever. "
Or Thanksgiving. 
"Well Tommy, I will try to make it to Bloomington, probably in December. "
In December. 
"Yeah, but with the Christmas time because my family is in. "
"Evansville, so I'm "
OK. 
Gonna drive up on the way to Indy so I'm there. 
I'll buy you a beer. 
Let's do that. 
My healer you're there too so. 
That sounds good. 
So you went in person instead of online. 
That sounds great. 
I think we're good till Monday. 
We've got. 
We've got some things in line. 
"Yeah, yeah. "
OK. 
It's going to. 
"Be it's going to be a week of of trying to drive to the end here, so everybody enjoy the weekend and we'll, we'll come in hard on Monday. "
"Yeah, rest up so goodnight everyone. "
Alright bye thank you. 
Good luck honey. 
Do you like the brain addition to the E? 
No thanks. 
I added one thing Matt at the end today and that was a a post survey. 
And I actually grabbed this 'cause I used it yesterday when I spoke at A at the Indiana Tech Conference. 
The GCC. 
"And I already had it designed and it would be applicable in whatever ideas United would do, so I just dropped the, uh, QR code in there and said post survey link. "
Follow up administrative guides. 
I think that really supports it really. 
"OK, you want to me to take us through here we have. "
"Well, yeah. "
The contingency plan for remote teaching and instructional adaptability. 
We have to add the table contents. 
"Yeah, and now. "
That I think everything is going to stay. 
"Where it's at, I can do that tomorrow. "
Then we can. 
"Overview which I took from the UM, I think our very first assignment. "
And then I just threw Anesti logo. 
Love it. 
"So, and I think the other one is also from the flow chart was from our objectives. "
With love 
This was this was done up and made prettier by Kim. 
Thank you Kim. 
"Oh, you made it much prettier with green and blue. "
I I added and white. 
He looks good. 
Change the colors. 
I'm down to objectives. 
And no changes to that one except from. 
"Yeah, Tommy. "
We change the language. 
You and I. 
What we changed from utilize to come. 
"Now, what was they originally? "
Create accounts and we changed that supplies based on the feedback. 
"Yeah, the feedback was that we weren't going to have time to have them create accounts and so they should already be created. "
Therefore we are going to utilize personal accounts. 
So we're assuming the accounts exist. 
Instructional elements. 
We have our diagnostic data collection. 
We have our. 
Evaluation of course creation or. 
We need to delete pardek. 
Is that correct? 
Yes it is. 
Should this change to utilization instead of creation? 
Chris Paul July yes. 
There it is. 
We have the self assessment and the session call quality survey which I put at the end. 
"This is all marrying between mine, so this is good. "
Right? 
Perfect. 
"Learners will evaluate the workshop in their own learning using Self assessment survey and sessions quality survey using Google forms, which has been. "
"Introduction to swiveling, which we also have the pretty pretty things here, with the the addition of color. "
None of this is new. 
So I did use the word swiveling yesterday just for some. 
"I did a session on making formative assessment more engaging in virtual settings, and I said we're not going to use the word pivot in here. "
We're going to soften this blow by using the word. 
"Swivel and everybody loved that idea, so I had a room of 50 all 50 teachers and administrators thought it was outstanding. "
So there you go. 
"I said, well, we're currently working on swiveling as a trademark. There it is 2022 Trademark Matthew Landreth. "
Department of Defense. United States. 
"Step four, are we going to keep that language? "
OK. 
I think we changed the same language to utilize. 
Implementation plan for media student integration swivel instruction. 
"Oh, I see what you're talking about. "
Anticipating this is already in here correct? 
So we need to switch the language. 
"Oh, I like that. "
"I'm just looking at your SWOT analysis, I'm sorry. "
I need to focus compare. 
How about we just change it to? 
Not perfect. 
Discuss 'cause that's what they're going to do. 
And the discussion should also include. 
OK. 
That makes more sense and then we just while you were in in here Cam we just. 
Started getting artifacts snapshots that we thought made sense at each part here. 
And aligned them in with the objectives. 
So we have our glows and grows here. 
We have our SWOT analysis. 
Thanks Haley. 
We have 
Diagnostic survey self assessment which we said earlier. 
We have a copy of the poll Everywhere data collection that we're doing within the this session. 
Personalized accounts for each swiveling tool. 
"Yeah, they'll utilize their own accounts already created. "
Quick start guides. 
"We threw these in from what you did, Kim. "
Matt turned them. 
Into Jpegs so that we could use those drop. 
I'm so sorry Matt. 
"Oh, that's OK. "
I I converted them and then I completely forgot to upload them so I that was my. 
Don't say it. 
"Fault no, we we've got him here. "
That was easy. 
"Yeah, we have our we have our time allocation. "
"Oh, current practices. Tool selection. We kind of changed some of this so that there could be some content creation with within their collaboration utilizing the accounts that they already have in Objective 2.2. "
Let's say that. 
And our follow up materials I generically created an admin guide for community collaboration and then made some stuff up. 
Our sessions experience longitudinal success when school districts create opportunities for teachers to collaborate and showcase their use of swiveling strategies. 
This is exemplified when district missions are upheld by the integration switch. 
Online professional development support. 
"We, as the idea is United, offer online collaborative tools for teachers to become actively immersed in online learning communities, and we read and please reach out to our contact information via social media email that would just be what we would do if we were in the session. "
That was my thought. 
"Like you can support us, here are these things. "
"Yeah, pretty cool stuff. "
"And then I put a QR code in here for post session survey which is linked to this right here, which shows when we would collect their information. "
And then. 
Get their emails and then go through various components of quality assurance within. 
Why did you choose this session? 
Blah blah blah. 
This is kind of generic that I would use responses from yesterday's and we could use the data that was collected in the surveys to show why they. 
OK. 
Chose this or. 
Did people agree or disagree? 
"Strongly agree that wasn't too bad from yesterday, OK? "
And that brings us to the end of. 
The instructional guide. 
Thoughts swivelling ideas? 
"No, that's really going to help the end of the formative evaluation for sure, because I didn't know if things were set in stone or if they weren't so dumb. "
"Perfect, now that I know where that lies that is. "
You want to share yours? We move on to whoever's going to go. 
"Next, I think that's ready to go. "
We really tried to align it with the length and some of the ideas of the last example that was shown. 
"And Kim, would you like to share first? "
Since we've already moved to assessment? 
I am. 
"Alright, so. "
"Uhm, let me go to. "
So this is the formative evaluation. 
"And there are, UM. "
Let me go back to. 
Four parts of the formative evaluation purposes target audience. 
The process materials and then the outcomes including the five areas listed and the revision plan to give you an idea of what's going on. 
"So I I went through, I picked out a subject matter. "
"Expert, an instructional designer who is specific and currently employed as a K through 12 consultant. "
"I thought that this would be the most appropriate person for us to use, and somebody who also was. "
Providing instruction for the COVID-19 pandemic move to remote instruction. I think that's a really important piece that we chatted about. 
So you can read through it. 
"It's also on the Google Doc as well, and it's in the folder and I can share with you. "
Just give me one second I can share with you the copy a link to it. 
"If you want to follow along with me, so that's right in the chat now. "
Thank you. 
So I went through and gave them expectations. 
Evaluate the objectives. 
Measure the appropriateness. 
Determine the appropriateness of instruction. 
So measure the appropriateness of the learning objectives or the instructional materials that are. 
Provided determine the appropriateness of the instruction. 
Consider the time of the instruction and then evaluate. 
The assessments that we have and then appraise what we have for a learner workbook. 
Come for them to use. 
"This then I chose, uh, a target learner, and this is a 6th grade teacher from our targeted learning population. "
"Who's had experience in the K through 12 setting? Obviously, and most importantly, that they've had experience pivoting during the COVID-19 pandemic, so they are going to evaluate the learning objectives. The relevance of the learning instructional materials, the flow of the instructional materials. "
"The time of the instruction, and then the materials that are giving given to them. "
The audience characteristics for this subject matter expert. 
"I was thinking, Doctor Mike Carlin, so I tried to paint that picture of him because he does do things with K through 12 and he does a lot of web based instruction design. "
"So I tried to paint that picture for him in my mind, so he's an instructional consultant adjunct professor at Indiana University in our department, and then he's done several projects related to pivot instruction. "
And then the targeted learner is a person who's Caucasian midcareer female instructed during the COVID-19 pandemic and is already using instructional tools. 
So we must have been on the same wavelength when you were talking about using personal accounts because I put that in there as well. 
"So the way that the subject matter expert process worked, all the interviews for the subject matter expert were conducted via zoom because of budget and travel protocols. "
Right now during COVID. 
"We did lots of formative evaluations, so the first time that we met was over the topic and one of the reasons why was because what you just hit on that pivoting is such a negative word and making sure to get that negative connotation. "
The bias from pivoting. 
"Towards a positive swivelling strategy is is important, so I put in there that we had a non structured and unstructured no questions created beforehand. "
Interview where we met with the subject matter expert upon creation. 
"Of the idea, and to be able to have an unbiased discovery based brainstorming session? "
Because the best brainstorming is done without. 
"Coming in with an objective, so thinking about that. "
"Then once we completed all the materials he was given the instructor guide, learning manual presentations, instructor accounts for instructional tools. "
We then guided him through paying attention to specific. 
Things through the process and then I got up to the interview questions for the subject matter expert. 
And so I'm making those interview questions as being very concise. 
"Like yes, no questions if we if you look in some of the other formative evaluation. "
"Uhm, parts. "
They are double barreled. 
"I don't know how they were able to get full credit for that, so I'm trying to make these single barrel just easy to answer questions that. "
Can be. 
I guess compounded more as we as we go through it so all I have left after that. 
Is to do UM? 
Doo Doo Doo. 
The targeted learner evaluation process so that was going to be through UM. 
"Through an interview and then interview questions which you already have interview questions, which is great so I can add those interview questions in and and put them on a Likert scale and then go through and and just plug and chug for the. "
"Activities, usefulness, learner comments, and the instructor inferred usefulness for all of those different things, including the learning objectives for each so. "
That's basically and then the revision plan. 
Is going to be. 
"Just the changes to come up with, so I'm kind of actually glad in this case that I haven't had a whole lot of, UM. "
I haven't had a whole lot of time to look through. 
Some of the stuff that you guys have already developed because I feel like I'm the person who's taking the formative evaluation and putting it in and just being able to critically evaluate it. 
"So I apologize for not having it completely done, but it is the first thing on my list and I have been working working at it. "
This is great. 
You don't have to feel. 
"Sorry or anything, this is great. "
So is there anything that I need to change? 
Is there anything that's not jiving? 
And I can do you want me to stop sharing my screen? 
Or do you want me to go slower through it? 
Can you said that you feel this is not done yet? 
So is there any part that you would like us to work on together? 
That's a good question. 
I think at this point. 
So let me show you. 
I'm going to pull it. 
"OK, so this is what the other team did. "
They have a table that they went and they put in all of the different activities and the usefulness of those activities. 
The learner comment. 
And the inferred usefulness. 
And as I was going through the. 
As I was going through the formative evaluation section for our chapter. 
"They kind of use this, they don't have it specifically in here, but they kind of use this format in this case to be able to create this. "
"So all I have to do now that I know what the instruction is specifically, I just got to put it in there so it's it's relative. "
This is going to be. 
"I I shouldn't say easy, but this is a plug and chug kind of thing at this point, so I only probably have another couple, maybe 3 hours of work. "
So I I got the majority completed. 
I read the directions wrong at 1st and so I inverted the learner and the subject matter expert. 
So once I got those. 
Really hammered out then I I was able to go through UM. 
And and figure it all out. 
Right? 
Sex on to me. 
Looks good. 
"It looks a lot of work, thank you. "
So I will have this all completed. 
I just need the weekend so. 
So it's raining here it's awesome and I can really focus. 
"Nobody is visiting and everybody is healthy, so this is the only thing on my plate and I will not let you down. "
"You're doing great, really. "
I'll just briefly share what I have. 
For now I'm I'm not sure if I'm done because. 
It's Monday when Tommy and Matt I jumped into Tommy and Matt's meeting and we kind. 
Of reviewed a little bit. 
In the structure guide I. 
Haven't really mapped a lot. 
So I. 
"No, this is a cover page, and I mean, uh, table of contents include, like instruction review. "
I I should I should put this. 
"In the chat, sorry. "
Right? 
"OK, so the question I have is what materials do we want students? "
"No, the our students are the teachers. "
We want the participants to read to refer to in this. 
Uhm learner manual. 
'cause this is the thing they're gonna be holding on when they're in the workshop. 
And that's my question. 
This is the welcome instruction. 
Feel free to edit it. 
"I'm not sure if I'm wording it appropriately, so just feel free to jump in and do any. "
"Uhm, added that you think it's necessary. "
And for here I feel like. 
We may. 
This do you want to have this image showing there too to just let them know what standard are we using? 
What do you guys think? 
You would like to have it. 
I would say. 
Keep it out because it'll get busy and. 
It will throw. 
Formatting so. 
"Yeah, sure, let me let's just leave it this way. "
And the overview part I've had put the goals here. 
This is like the subjective we have. 
And the preparation is basically. 
Like like the requirement the technical requirements we need them to have before attending this workshop. 
OK. 
Yes please. 
"Alright, thank you Kim. "
And and I'm not really sure about this part. 
"Come tell me about, do we have this? "
In the Google formula. 
Newer instructors guide. 
More read. 
Use virtual networks. 
This is this is like the data collection. 
Before the workshop. 
Are studying this. 
Word hanging up. 
I I wouldn't come. 
"Do you have a picture of it, Haley? "
My snapshot of. 
I think with. 
What it looks like. 
It's going to be on page 10 right? 
We just. 
Took a little. 
So if do we need to put the questions under there? 
"Uhm, I will simply just have a link or. "
We can probably. 
OK. 
More questions 'cause if we if they want to review it in a digital format they can just click and then get into the survey. 
You want a link to the survey. 
"Yes, please, thank you. "
So I'll keep the questions. 
I've output the link. 
Let me see the questions real quick 'cause I need to. 
I wasn't. 
I wasn't prepared to. 
I actually make it. 
I was just faking it. 
So let me do this. 
Question how often? 
"OK, new question. "
"Yeah, I'll fix this real quick. "
Add question. 
One of the big things Haley is that. 
"Uhm, and I don't need to jump ahead. "
I'm just for the SWOT analysis with the UM. 
With yeah so I would make those. 
"Those if you're gonna have them right in this book, they need to be big. "
OK. 
I'm sorry I didn't mean to jump ahead. 
No no no. 
"Uh, I I just uhm, I made this chart like in a minute Monday during our meeting, 'cause Tommy and Matt made like a screenshot. "
So just briefly business. 
Traveling about it. 
"Oh yeah, no. "
"Or we can have, uh? "
"Like much more prettier, I just. "
I didn't really work on it. 
"And Haley, I'm just updating some of the utilized versus create that changed Tuesday or so. "
I was thinking swimming. 
"Oh, OK. "
Here's something completely useless. 
Disease years. 
I'm carrying out like equal is. 
Is that me or? 
"No, no, we're good. "
I'm taking up please. 
Thank you. 
That sounds very much like a theater. 
Sorry to have you guys added this. 
It's me. 
I'm still. 
"You're fine, it's all good. "
That's what we're here for. 
No Tommy. 
Do you have that link? 
In the chat. 
"Alright, thank you so much. "
There you go. 
Thank you. 
Just have like paste here. 
Second option. 
Move out. 
"So, so we do have some. "
"Uh will form service theory, which is great. "
I don't think we need this. 
This is. 
And we don't need that either. 
I'll just pull out the questions here on Mcdunn. 
So we have the phones here. 
This is. 
Is this looks OK too? 
I think it. 
Does I? 
I think it's good for them to be able to see this side by side and the information up top is easy to understand. 
Great then this is OK. 
And the SWOT analysis is bigger. 
I thought of this lot here. 
I'll just to just make those. 
As separate pages. 
"I'll do, I'll do that. "
Do we need any? 
"Like materials for this part, or maybe I'll just. "
And copy and paste what we have in instructor guide. 
"Oh, this is for. "
Strategy 2. 
Beach please. 
Is there anything we want to add to this? 
I can make the edit. 
Does it look OK or do we want to add any resources for the students? 
I was wondering like what kind of? 
"Uh, materials, do we wanna have them like holding their hands now listening? "
Or participating in the workshop. 
"It's like too much words we don't want, like more pictures or anything else. "
That's a good question. 
I think it's OK. 
We have she's here. 
But do we want like screenshots in the actual software or? 
I'm just gonna have the teachers present. 
"In practicality, it would be the teachers. "
"Uhm, from a learner centered and engagement perspective for this session. "
"I don't know exactly what what she's going to want, but what do you think Matt? "
"I mean, in my experience as a curriculum director, facilitator, and trainer and we don't. "
We don't want to. 
"Pigeonhole their exploration here, but if we need to to show that we are trying to make them explore and that's one thing. "
And we don't have to do this. 
"But I'm just wondering, like from your practical perspective. "
What do you think? 
"Refer, yeah, could that want to be a little? "
Bit more organic and just let them go. 
"So we don't want screenshots now, just. "
The heart it's risky too because especially with Google products or what was it we were using even the other night it changes day to day without notice. 
"Exactly, yeah. "
The screenshots can be a little dangerous. 
Times I tried finding manuals for narrow and flipgrid they do not exist and one of the reasons why they they stated and it's true is because they're they're changing all the time. 
So they can change the coursework easy. 
"And Google, I guess whenever you try to refer to them says refer to our blog. "
And we'll keep you up. 
"Yeah, exactly. "
"Before blog, we'll keep you up to date. "
"OK, great no, we don't need screenshots. "
And uhm. 
Anything about the wording I'll I'll clean up the format. 
"I actually have one like on my computer, but it doesn't work when. "
I upload it to to Google so I'll just clean up. 
"Do you need help with this, Haley? "
Do you want me to help you work with work on it? 
Even the four in the formatting or the wording? 
Like with with all of it. 
"Whatever, what, what do you need help with? "
I basically have the content here. 
My question was just what kind of materials we want to have. 
Like we would if we would prefer to have these sheets instead of screenshotting. 
"I think I'm fine, but do you guys? "
Think there's anything missing that? 
I will just continue to work on this. 
It's something I know you have a lot of stuff on your list. 
"It's it's not it, it's fine, it's perfectly fine. "
"I'm a full time student, so. "
I I don't have my full time job anymore. 
Until next year. 
"Yeah, then this. "
"Yeah, we can work on this together. "
Just let me know what's missing here. 
"Yeah, uhm, maybe I was. "
"I will just throw this out there, but maybe it would be good at the very beginning to just have a, uh, like a page where the instructors. "
They have a prompt of write down everything that. 
Everything that you enjoyed about online instruction during COVID-19 and then one of everything you hated. 
About online instruction during COVID-19 and then maybe at least that would be kind of the glow and grow too. I wouldn't put him side by side though. 
And maybe that would be a good kickoff where they could go around if we wanted to. 
"Just like you know, what did you guys enjoy? "
What did you not like about it and then what did you enjoy? 
And then we can kick off from there. 
"I know we're just throwing something out, it's a random thought. "
"Well, that's great. "
Tell me I'm mad. 
You guys like that idea. 
I can add a page of that. 
I left that idea like an icebreaker. 
Or like at the very beginning before everything. 
Or maybe sure. 
"Oh, I had it. "
"Later, after this meeting, I don't wanna waste all. "
"Of your time, is there anything else that? "
You guys like to help you. 
"So I guess as they go through the instruction, or at least this has been helpful for me as an instructor that. "
Let's say we're going through Miro that they just have a page in their workbook of this is Miro. 
This these are the important takeaways from euro and then maybe some tips or tricks and then they can. 
Have another sheet that is. 
"This is the stuff about flipgrid and then you can go into the SWOT analysis from there, but at least they would have that as like a a takeaway for the instruction and. "
"You know something where they can have like a reference guide back to it, but it's it's simple, something really simple. "
'cause that might be able to marry that. 
The swat of of like OK. 
Somebody told me when and this is how I. 
Lead all of my instruction is. 
Tell him what you're gonna do. 
Do it. 
"Reflect on it, tell him what you're going to do again, and make sure that you tie it all together. "
"So if you have to tell him again and again and again, it's OK because at least it's gonna. "
They're gonna take something away from it. 
OK. 
'cause what? 
I'm the one that I'm looking at? 
Is the student workbook for the army oh ROTC? 
On the UM. 
On the the over the instructional design project overview for the course for 521. 
And they their instructor guide goes. 
It essentially has like a little beginning. 
"The contents and intro, but it's really easy to understand where it's not necessarily what we have done, but it's like this is what we're going to do today and then. "
"These are the the goals, so like what you have at the beginning with the goals for instruction. "
I think it's I think it's great. 
Because who wants to really read learning objectives and and then under that you would just go into? 
Just like a brief overview. 
Hopefully that helps that I don't. 
"Yeah, that's really 'cause I was like. "
I was stuck in this and thinking about. 
"Well, will do we need to. "
"Put in here, that's really good. "
"Yeah, I'll keep working. "
I'll keep working on that and. 
The message is. 
You're doing a great job. 
"This is your first time doing this, so. "
"I'm so sorry, Matt. "
"No, I'm I am so sorry. "
'cause you guys are really? 
Experienced and I'm trying to catch catch up with like all the ideas I'm keeping I'm. 
"Keeping those here, yeah. "
"I put a link in the chat to a document that I have borrowed from for myself, but I like how then reflection my notes and they're instructed in their learner manual. "
Like can I see myself using the strategy and for what or when? 
It's just like a little? 
Reflection my notes addition. 
That's not even necessarily part of the instruction itself. 
"So I think if you keep scrolling down, you can kind of see where they've used this little text. "
Boxes like that to take notes and. 
That's nice. 
What would this strategy look like in my classroom? 
What should my students be doing? 
And this little notes kind of like Cornell notes for teachers. 
It's really nice thinking that. 
OK. 
I'll definitely refer to that and to the project I can mentioned. 
And just like this. 
Clear out. 
"Haley, do you wanna meet with me on Monday? "
And we can. 
"See like by that time I'll I'll have everything done for the formative evaluation, and, uhm, I can see. "
"If you're not well, I don't know if you're going to work on this this weekend, but we I could see where you're where you are and how I can help you and then that way we can all come together. "
"If you guys want to meet next week, so wrap things up. "
That would be great. 
"If you have time, thank you. "
I have tons of time Hun. 
No more interviews. 
So do we all meet next Monday or? 
We can. 
I don't think. 
"Sure, just to know. "
I guess cross teeth dot eyes and turn things in. 
Same to them. 
Same time. 
Right? 
"I'll be at the the car dealership getting my oil change, so I'll be sitting in the middle of the there room. "
Maybe I'll try to get into a an expensive vehicle. 
"No problem, sounds good. "
"Really, is that gonna give you enough time to get your? "
To get the what you need to get done. 
"Uhm, yeah, I'll be working on that today and tomorrow. "
So if I have any. 
"More questions, I'll just message you. "
"OK, if you want to meet this weekend let me know. "
I have nothing going on so I can meet with you this weekend and we can tackle things as. 
"Well OK yeah, you got the you've got a lot of work and I want to make sure that you're supported so. "
Thank you so much. 
You're welcome. 
I'm nervous. 
"Thank you, thank you. "
I'll be working on this today and see like how much I can complete in. 
I'll let you know. 
"Why don't you check in with me tomorrow if I don't hear from you, I'll text you OK. "
"OK, thank you OK. "
OK. 
All right everybody. 
"Not that I don't want to include Tommy and Matt, but we can definitely tackle this together. "
You and I so. 
"Enjoy the rest of your Friday, Matt. "
I think. 
Oh I will. 
Everybody else. 
"Look that over, yeah. "
"Hey, I think I already saw something under formative. "
Did you already submit that? 
"I did, I submitted it just in case. "
"So then it had multiple tries, so I said, well if there's a problem with it, then uhm, then I can resubmit it. "
That's what it was like. 
It's just another thing off the checklist. 
I see that it's in here I'm I'm looking at. 
This submission looks great. 
You guys are awesome. 
Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. 
Well thanks everybody. 
So the other two parts ready to go. 
Do we all submit instructional artifacts? 
"No, just one of us submits. "
OK here yeah. 
So if you want I can submit all of them for us on everybody behalf. 
Kim's the submitter. 
OK. 
"That sounds really, uh. "
"Uh, misogynistic to call somebody a submitter? "
Oh no. 
It's OK. 
I'm sorry about that. 
That was not the context. 
"It's fine, it's all good. "
So what we left for this course? 
Reflection and peer evaluation reflection I wrote about you guys. 
And how awesome. 
You were so. 
I submitted the peer evaluation. 
Was it just one or do each of us do it 'cause I I submit it for everybody. 
You can look at it. 
If you can see that. 
Right or is that the one? 
That we have to email her. 
"Uhm, the peer one I think is the one you have to email her and then there's like the self one. "
The final the the reflection 1. 
"Yep, I talked about how awesome you were in my final reflection, too. "
"We're supposed to email her the peer evaluation, not put it in the submission window. "
"OK, I'll drop it out. "
"I I submitted it through the window which was open, but I'll also email it to her. "
Thanking her for the experience in this course and the wonderful experience with ideas United. 
I think we might have been the only group that actually went and made like their own little branding material listen. 
This is this is this. 
"This is LLC, I think moving forward is a consultation firm. "
"Speaking of that, if you guys would like to go rogue with me on research this morning, I had this idea to create. "
A burner accounts on A and submit. 
Job postings or submit resumes to. 
Instructional design positions in corporate America and see the response from. 
"From them, because all my experiences in education to see how many of them would give me a call or an interview because I'm an educator and then do a separate profile to the same people with all my experience in graphic design with less experience and less time to see if I got one. "
'cause what I think is I would get twice as many responses from my. 
Work outside of education and then to be able to write that. 
How do we recruit teachers into the field when the world perceives and devalues the the work of a teacher? 
It's a little odd ethical. 
Very funny. 
Little unethical and how? 
"We'd have to trick people, but it would all be. "
Disaggregated in anonymous 
"So if we could write that book, I think it could be a New York Times bestseller. "
Of course. 
Ideas United collect information about the value of a teacher through the application process for instructional design. 
In Corporate America or outreaches outside of KP K16 education institutions. 
"That's that's like Robin Hood of research, right? "
Because you're you're. 
It's like a front page topic. 
You already have that. 
That's a good start. 
"Yeah, I think I'm gonna do it and then obviously I can't apply it to anything because it's, uh, it's going to be unethical. "
Research modalities. 
Not exactly IRB approved. 
"It's not IRB approved, but it will be like multimedia approved in. "
People like eat people won't. 
I approve it. 
People will eat it up like candy. 
"Uh, I think anyway. "
So what do we got left here people? 
Are we gonna have a follow up zoom here where we just drink on zoom? 
"Hey, I'm in favor of that one. "
Close to the end of the project. 
Are you coming up? 
When are you coming to Indiana? 
"Uhm, probably around the 19th 20th. "
"Oh OK, so end of the week. "
"So Oh no, the 19th the 20th of December 2nd. "
December OK. 
"Yeah, sorry. "
"Perfect so yeah, it states the 18th and then so probably. "
They're coming back full. 
Indiana Room yeah closer to Christmas. 
What about anybody else? 
Are you guys traveling places for holidays? 
Not this year. 
Why not? 
That's good. 
"Uhm, there's a like a light festival in Nashville. "
This Saturday night. 
I'm going to that one. 
You're going to Nashville. 
"Yes, there's like. "
Tennessee not Indiana. 
"Yeah, Tennessee, not Indiana. "
There's so many Nashville's and Bloomington's around. 
It's late. 
"It's my, uh, my place of solitude is to go to Nashville. "
I've I think I I've recorded 4 records in Nashville in or around and I always enjoy it. 
I have a former student now who's a songwriter for RCA Records. 
"Uhm, who I got to take to Nashville? "
That was one of my favorite things as a teacher. 
Had a kid who played golf for me and he came and said I want to play guitar so he taught himself to play guitar on my couch. 
"My wife and I would make him pizza rolls and throw him into our spare room, and I say use all my equipment and he taught himself and in three months he was better than me and. "
Then he went away to to Ohio University in. 
"Communications and after sophomore year called me and said coach, I just want to play guitar and write. "
I'm gonna move to that. 
"I want to move to Nashville, so I said really your your parents are OK with you dropping out of college to chase this dream. "
His dad is a principal. 
"No, it was. "
"Hard for me to call him and say, hey, I want to send some of your videos to producers in Nashville that I know. "
So I did and they called me 6 hours later and said can you have him here tomorrow so we went down and now he's a published signed songwriter and. 
Is 23 and. 
Probably probably a 5 three years away from you hearing his stuff in big ways on Top 40 Billboard charts. 
Wow wow impressive. 
Pretty sure. 
"Yeah, he's a Haley. You might. I don't know. You would probably like him. His name is Knox with the KKNOX Morris Knox. It's naxon. "
"Uhm, like Spotify and Apple, but he he writes he's like pop punk rider, but pretty cool stuff. "
"I'm clearly not a pop punk writer, but I'm. "
I told him I said all I want from you is 2 tickets to the Grammys. 
When you get there so I can buy my. 
Wife a pretty dress. 
It's been one night hanging out with. 
"The big people, and then we'll leave. "
That'll be it. 
"And so what's his name again, Tommy? "
Knox knocked Morris. 
"Morris, but it just comes up his knocks on. "
"OK, I think I do. "
Have him on. 
"Oh, he's on Spotify. "
I'm definitely checking him up. 
"He's great, he's he's very Ed Sheeran in how he writes songs if that makes sense. "
"Oh really, love isheri. "
Hearing Ed Sheeran. 
He's even redheaded like Ed Sheeran. 
"What else do we have here, folks? "
"I'm just cleaning it up for submission, so I think I'm good on my end. "
And all I have to do is drop this pure evaluation. 
Hey I went full Kim on this though and gave myself 14 instead of 15 'cause I missed that meeting with. 
For professional accountability toward the group. 
Oh please please. 
Oh I submitted a wrong assignment. 
She couldn't even open it. 
"She's like, please send us the thing and I'm like what are you talking about and I I think I was at like the supermarket or something and having like a panic attack and. "
I'm like. 
"Oh well, I can't get my one drive to. "
Work and I'm. 
Like stupid phone. 
I'm having a meltdown like a child. 
I might have. 
I might have swore. 
I can't help myself. 
Are you recording you are recording this Haley OK? 
OK. 
I didn't swear. 
I'm talking about I'm talking about songwriting in Nashville and all kinds of things getting recording this. 
Some sort of? 
Academic work. 
"Yes, these are like chit chat that we have like those off topic conversations which are really valuable data. "
It's data. 
"I think you guys you can. Uh, you can grade portfolios for me today I have to grade five of these that are between 50 and 100 pages of student portfolios today so. "
Oh wow. 
Where do you go? 
"Oh my gosh, that's awful. "
"Oh, it's my job. "
"It's the their their spring portfolio which is their gateway to student teaching in the spring, so they have to pass this and then it prepares them. "
Then to take the the national norm Ed TPA exam or FTP assessment in the spring. 
"So there's a lot of students who are drinking today already because they just submitted an 80 page portfolio last night at 11:59, fifty nine when. "
It was due at 12. 
They're sitting on there with like 6 Red Bulls going OK. 
"OK, OK now. "
Right? 
"Good luck, so yeah, it's a it's a fun week because we build them up. "
"We we start with our secondary program July, the first Tuesday after 4th of July and they go through the developmental stages of the adolescent brain and then we put them through planning bootcamp. "
They take Ed Ed. 
"Psych in there and then they come right into the program where they're in the schools for 1/2 day every day in the fall, and then they have to collect evidence and build through this portfolio before they go into their full 60 days to and teaching, starting when they come back in January. "
So that's my job is to manage that that program. 
So that's a lot. 
"Yeah, so that's that's intense. "
It's one it's one job. 
"Today my job is Dad and oil change this morning, while while grading you know. "
Are you girls feeling better? 
They are can you say hi? 
She's just. 
Hanging out here. 
"Yeah, they're feeling better, but they gave it to me, so now I'm. "
How's the? 
How's the pink guy? 
Pink eye I did not get but the the respiratory. 
Right? 
I'm just checking out this this yellow car in the distance I wanna. 
I wanna go go over here and jump in that. 
That is not teacher salary car right there. 
Not at all. 
That's my dearest united after we become a consultant. 
"Absolutely, that is all four of us get those in different colors and then we take pictures as we come in in our sports convertible sports cars with bright blue, bright yellow, bright red. "
Come on car. 
Corvettes just coming in like that. 
I should show you guys what I have been making this week. 
"Yes, sleep do. "
I gotta unplug myself. 
Oh my gosh. 
Here we go. 
For what? 
"Oh well, my. "
"My dad is a former auto mechanic, so the garage is attached to the house. "
And everything is kind of handicapped because my dad has two artificial hips and all kinds of problems so but. 
That's a really huge garage. 
"Two that's on a lift, but I built that run in. "
Shed for the. 
Cast so. 
That way we can. 
She can have some shelter. 
I just gotta Tyvek it and then. 
Today we're going to. 
Figure out how we're going to move. 
It from here to where the cows are. 
This is a good like. 
It's a good like. 
8th of a mile maybe so. 
Oh so yeah. 
That's cool. 
"Yeah, I had no plans, I just drew it up and cut it. "
Put it together. 
"So we'll we'll see if it works, but. "
"Already it, it seems like it's going to. "
"Be great, but. "
"When I get sick of being on the computer or reading, I just go out there and I start doing stuff tinkering it. "
It's actually really. 
"It's really nice, makes you makes you appreciate. "
Having a job. 
"Oh, and then the other thing I made this week. "
It's a beautiful view out of your window. 
"Oh, what is this? "
It's a tractor diaper cake. 
What about one of the people at work? 
It's actually the dairy herdsman she's she's having a baby. 
So I made her a John Deere tractor diaper cake with all kinds. 
Of little things. 
That's very neat. 
So I I gotta get it to her before she goes on maternity leave. 
So we're actually heading out to New York back to New York this week. 
So that way I can get it to her. 
"But yeah, so sorry I didn't. "
"Didn't mean to take up your time, but nobody really gets to see my projects they. "
Wetherden they look like crap so you got to see. 
Him in the garage. 
"Well, I love that piece. "
It looks great and it. 
"Really, it has this very they had. "
It had this like cute. 
Atmosphere around it can feel it. 
"Yeah, it's going to be nice. "
"She's going to have the caps going to be able to have light, and then I made it so we have like a movable top to it so you can open it up. "
"Uhm, it'll be. "
It'll be good. 
I'm excited. 
"It's kind of cold here now, but I know that it snowed in Bloomington. "
So I'm not going. 
To complain 'cause I think it's going to be 50 here today. 
So what's the? 
What's the weather like? 
"Where your Matt where you are, Matt? "
"It's been enough 40s, mostly so. "
It's not too bad. 
40S and sunny and very dry. 
I think tonight is supposed to get to freezing. 
OK. 
All right everybody. 
What do we what do we have here? 
I think I think we're good. 
We're done working. 
"Good, let me. "
"Uh, I've gotta email my evaluation here. "
That's what I have to do. 
That's the last piece. 
Case evaluation. 
Lieber and. 
3 year old behaving very. 
"Very well here today, so she's trying to get a treat for lunch. "
Deserve it. 
Could you what kind of? 
"Treat, do you think you should get? "
Can you tell the camera what do you think? 
Can you tell me what kind of tree? 
She said ice cream. 
Ice cream sounds good. 
"What, what, what flavor? "
Flavor of ice cream. 
You want vanilla or chocolate chocolate with sprinkles. 
Chicago with sprinkles. 
There's only two flavors. 
For Hershey's 
I don't know. 
"That's OK, Hun. "
You can get us Sunday. 
More flavors that way. 
Hard or soft? 
Harder soft serve. 
Soft serve. 
Dairy Queen Dairy Queen. 
Dairy Queen 
"Oh girl, that is. "
"Awesome, I love me some Dairy Queen. "
"Especially the dilly bars, they're so good. "
"Oh yeah, Billy. "
And the way that they make the the ice cream. 
Go Bush Bush. 
Like a snowman. 
"I have Dairy Queen, but I have cold stone next to me. "
Oh my gosh. 
Put some Creamery next to me. 
That's like the only American ice cream I can. 
"Find, but it's cold still. "
"Well, there's cold stone in Turkey. "
We have a cold stone in the building next to mine. 
"That's awesome, I'd be fine then. "
I could go cold stone. 
"And cold stone is next to Starbucks, so. "
"Well, it's like you're right at home, yeah? "
So I can't complain. 
Dergi OK. 
So we have this reflection activity. 
"Assignment this is just like a software, self reflection about. "
What you feel? 
"Yes, yeah. "
Like generally right OK? 
He has kind of two topics within that. 
You can address. 
"Yeah, OK. "
Alright we are. 
I'm gonna download the PDF now for the. 
"Learner manual, so that's done. "
And then I will do the. 
"Alright, I'll just combine them 'cause I think that there's only like 1 submission for an article. "
Wise OK. 
I just hit the home button. 
But we're good. 
This is gonna be a long week. 
So I think I have to combine these. 
"Or maybe they I submit them both at the same time, although it's never let me submit 2 files at once. "
Which is fine. 
"Uhm, because they're all a part of the in the instructional. "
"Right, let's see. "
"Wow, I can't believe we're like a week early. "
This is amazing. 
Ideas United don't mess around. 
That's right. 
OK cool alright I I'm good here. 
Just making sure my peer evaluation uploaded. 
And I can check off all these boxes. 
Sent messages. 
OK. 
Final reflection. 
Your evaluation. 
Formative evaluation. 
Instructional artifacts. 
"Now Hayley, which. "
"Wait, you used Appa? "
OK. 
I I answered my own question. 
"Sorry no, don't be well. "
I I don't think she mentioned any like standard. 
About the reference so. 
It's all good. 
I don't know.
